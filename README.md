angular-quickstart
===

This project is based on the [official Angular 2 quickstart](https://github.com/angular/quickstart).

Major adjustments:

* Awesome **Docker** support (i.e runs `unit` and `e2e` tests inside a `selenium container`)
* Awesome **folder structure** (i.e `dist`, `stylesheets`)
* Awesome application of the **DRY**, **YAGNI** and **KISS** principles
* Awesome refactor so the whole project can be easily renamed, just find by `angular-quickstart` ;)
* Removes `Wallaby` (because it is a paid service)
